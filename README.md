# movieapp
Movie app made while doing a freecodecamp tutorial, this is kinda a library, similar to theOdinProject library project that I'm going to cover a little later, after I get more of the basics of javascript.

This app basically connects to the moviedatabase api, that helps us search for any movie in the search bar.
On the main page we have some fresh realeses.
Even though we get to see the movie cover, I haven't done anything to link the movie cover or the title to the actual imdb link or something similar. I still have to learn a little more to that, because I want that to work on any movie that the users is chosing.
Had a fun time following the tutorial. 
Also I've chosen some fonts to change the title and the h3 from the main page from googlefonts.
